#Deployment
Azure DevOps played a crucial role in streamlining the development and deployment processes for the Comprehensive Netflix Content Analytics and Insights Dashboard. It facilitated version control by managing the repository where the Power BI files were stored and tracked changes. Azure DevOps also enabled Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, which automated the build, validation, and deployment of the Power BI reports. Through its pipelines, it ensured that updates to the dashboard were consistently and reliably deployed to the Power BI Service, enhancing collaboration and efficiency in managing the project lifecycle.
